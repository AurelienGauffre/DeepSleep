# deepsleep :zzz:
Sleep analysis from sound recording using Pytorch. 
First aim of this project is to build and tune general sound classifiers to detect automatically for instance somniloquy.

### Get the datasets
Run the following command to populate your `data/` folder with the datasets:
```shell
# fetch the datasets from Google Drive
poetry run python dev/get_data.py
```

### Update the datasets
The datasets from your local `data/` folder will be automatically updated to Google 
Drive as a `.zip` (reserved to maintainers):
```shell
# upload the local data/ folder to Google Drive
poetry run python dev/upload_data_to_drive.py
```
